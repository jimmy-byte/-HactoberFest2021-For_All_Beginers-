        <div class="timeline-item" year-is="1815">
          <p>
            On December 10, Augusta Ada Byron is born, only legitimate daughter
            of Lord George Gordan Byron, the poet, and Lady Anne Isabella Noel
            Byron, an education advocate.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item" year-is="1828">
          <p>
            At the age of 12, Ada Byron designs and begins to construct a flying
            machine.
          </p>

        <div class="timeline-item" year-is="1833">

            Ada Byron meets Charles Babbage, mathematician, philosopher,
            inventor and mechanical engineer. They begin to collaborate and
            correspond by letter, and Babbage writes to a friend that he has met
            "the Enchantress of Number."
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item" year-is="1835">
          <p>Ada Byron marries William King and adds King to her name.</p>

        <div class="timeline-item" year-is="1838">
          <p>
            Ada Byron King's husband is named Count of Lovelace and she becomes
            Ada Lovelace, the name by which she is most commonly known today.
          </p>

        <div class="timeline-item" year-is="1842">
          <p>
            Ada Lovelace translates, over the course of 9 months, the article by
            Luigi Menabrea, the Italian mathematician, on Babbage's proposed
            Analytical Machine.

        <div class="timeline-item" year-is="1843">
          <p>
            Ada Lovelace adds a set of notes, around 3 times longer than the
            translation of Menabrea's paper. In the last section, she writes a
            complete method to solving for a Bernoulli sequence on the
            Analytical Engine, later found to be correct.

        <div class="timeline-item" year-is="1844">
          <p>
            Ada Lovelace writes to a friend regarding her wish to mathematically
            model the brain, developing a "calculus of the nervous system."

        <div class="timeline-item" year-is="1852">
          <p>
            On November 27, Ada Lovelace dies from uterine cancer, exacerbated
            by bloodletting.

        <div class="timeline-item" year-is="1853">
          <p>
            Ada Lovelace's notes on the Analytical Engine are republished, and
            she becomes known as the first writer of an algorithm specifically
            designed to run on a computer.
