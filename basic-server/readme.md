# Simple Node.js Server

This is a basic Node.js server created using the Express.js framework. It responds with a "Hello from the server." message when you access the root URL ("/") in your web browser or through an HTTP client like Postman.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this server, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on the server.
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/): Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the server:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you've placed the server code.

3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the server by running the following command:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

   You should see a message in the terminal that says: "Listening on port : 3000."

5. Open your web browser or use an HTTP client like Postman and access the following URL: http://localhost:3000

   You should see the message "Hello from the server." displayed in your browser or client.

## Configuration

You can change the port the server listens on by modifying the `PORT` constant in the `index.js` file. For example, if you want the server to listen on port 8080, you can change it like this:

```javascript
const PORT = 8080;
```

Feel free to modify and extend this server for your own projects. Happy coding!
