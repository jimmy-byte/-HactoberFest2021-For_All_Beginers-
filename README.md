## Event details :

- HacktoberfestÂ® is open to everyone in our global community. Whether youâ€™re a developer, student learning to code, event host, or company of any size, you can help drive growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.

- Hacktoberfest is a celebration open to everyone in our global community.
- Pull requests can be made in any GitHub-hosted repositories/projects.
- You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.

## HacktoberFest Rules :

To earn your Hacktoberfest tee or tree reward, you must register and make four valid pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 (in any time zone). PRs can be made to any public repo on GitHub, not only the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the projectâ€™s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate. This year, the first 70,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will be eligible to receive a prize.
