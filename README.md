## HacktoberFest Rules :

<b>This year marks the 10th anniversary of Hacktoberfest, and we’re calling on your support! </b>
<br>

To earn your Hacktoberfest tree reward, you must register and make four valid pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 (in any time zone). Pull requests can be made in any GitHub or GitLab-hosted project participating in Hacktoberfest (look for the “hacktoberfest” topic). If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behaviour, not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate. The first 50,000 participants to have their first PR/MR accepted will have a tree planted in their name through Tree Nation.
